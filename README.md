 
    Welcome to Movie Time!
Movie Time is a CLI project made for a FlatIron School project.
It is a simple program which takes in a movies name from a user and returns specific info related to the film.
The program will give you a couple of options to choose from and will return data associated with those options.
It will then give you the option to search another film or exit the program, whichever you choose!
Note: Due to the program being a movie searching program, while inside of the specific film searching part of the run process, typing exit will return a movie named Exit, the exit command must be used outside of or after you have searched a movie!
Enjoy using Movie Time!
